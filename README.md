## Requirements

To use tg, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [Python >= 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


## Optional dependencies

- [terminal-notifier](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier) - for Mac (used by default). You can change it to [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) for Linux or any other notifications program (see `NOTIFY_CMD` in configuration)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - to record voice msgs and upload videos.
- [tdlib](https://tdlib.github.io/td/build.html?language=Python) - in case of incompatibility with built in package.
  For example, macOS:
  ```sh
  brew install tdlib
  ```
  and then set in config `TDLIB_PATH`
- `urlview` to choose urls when there is multiple in message, use `URL_VIEW` in config file to use another app (it should accept urls in stdin)
- to open `stickers` and `animated` ones (thumbnail preview) you need to set in mailcap appropriate handler and have app which will open `webp` file:
  ```ini
  image/webp; mpv %s
  ```
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - can be used to choose file when sending, customizable with `FILE_PICKER_CMD`
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - to create groups and secret chats (used for single and multiple user selection)

This option is recommended:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/src
cd ~/.local/src
git clone https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/arigram.git
cd arigram
./do local
```

And add this to `~/.bashrc` or whatever POSIX complient shell you use:

git pull
./do upgrade
```

or if you want to keep local changes

```sh
cd ~/.local/src/arigram
./do local
```

## Configuration

Config file should be stored at `~/.config/arigram/config.py`. This is simple python file.

### Simple config:

```python
# should start with + (plus) and contain country code
PHONE = "[phone number in international format]"
# For enable `PHONE = "+1234567890"`
```

### Advanced configuration:

All configurable variables can be found [here](/arigram/config.py)

```python
import os
from arigram.controllers import msg_handler
from plyer import notification
from arigram import config as tg_config
from simpleaudio import WaveObject
from threading import Thread


class Custom:
    def _play_wav(self, wave_path: str) -> Thread:
        def player() -> None:
            wave_obj = WaveObject.from_wave_file(wave_path)
            play_obj = wave_obj.play()
            play_obj.wait_done()

        sound = Thread(target=player)
        sound.setDaemon(True)

        return sound

    def _notify(self, title: str, message: str) -> Thread:
        def notifier() -> None:
            notification.notify(
                app_name=f"arigram {arigram.__version__}", title=title, message=message
            )

        notif = Thread(target=notifier)
        notif.setDaemon(True)

        return notif

        del args

        self._notify(str(kwargs.get("title")), str(kwargs.get("msg"))).start()

### Mailcap file

Mailcap file is used for deciding how to open telegram files (docs, pics, voice notes, etc.). Path to the file can be overriden with `MAILCAP_FILE` in config file.

Example: `~/.mailcap`

```ini
# media
video/*; mpv "%s"
audio/ogg; mpv --speed=1.33 "%s"
audio/mpeg; mpv --no-video "%s"
image/*; qview "%s"

# text
text/html; w3m "%s"
text/html; open -a Firefox "%s"
text/plain; less "%s"

# fallback to vim
text/*; vim "%s"
```


## Keybindings

ViM like keybindings are used in the project. Can be used commands like `4j` - 4 lines down.

### Chats:

- `j,k`: move up/down
- `J,K`: move 10 chats up/down
- `g`: go to top chat
- `l`: open msgs of the chat

## Msgs:

- `j,k`: move up/down

- `G`: move to the last msg (at the bottom)
- `D`: download file
- `l`: if video, pics or audio then open app specified in mailcap file, for example:

```ini
# Images
image/png; qView "%s"
audio/*; mpv "%s"
```

If text, open in `less` (to view multiline msgs)
- `e`: edit current msg
- `<space>`: select msg and jump one msg down (use for deletion or forwarding)
- `<ctrl+space>`: same as space but jumps one msg up
- `y`: yank (copy) selected msgs with <space> to internal buffer (for forwarding) and copy current msg text or path to file to clipboard
- `p`: forward (paste) yanked (copied) msgs to current chat
- `dd`: delete msg for everybody (multiple messages will be deleted if selected)
